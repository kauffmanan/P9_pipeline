# TNO Analysis Pipeline for Planet 9 Detection

This project provides a framework for a scientific data pipeline designed to analyze the orbits of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and search for evidence of the hypothetical Planet 9.

## Overview

The existence of a ninth major planet in our solar system has been postulated based on the anomalous clustering of distant TNOs. This pipeline aims to provide a systematic way to test this hypothesis by:

1.  **Simulating** synthetic TNO populations under various Planet 9 scenarios.
2.  **Correcting** for observational biases in existing TNO datasets.
3.  **Comparing** the observed data with simulated data using causal inference techniques to evaluate the evidence for Planet 9.

**Note:** This repository currently contains a boilerplate implementation. The core scientific logic is represented by placeholder functions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
/
|-- data/             # Data files
|   |-- raw/          # Raw, downloaded data
|   |-- processed/    # Processed and cleaned data
|-- src/              # Source code
|   |-- data_ingestion/ # Scripts for fetching data
|   |-- simulation/     # N-body simulation code
|   |-- analysis/       # Bias correction and causal inference
|   |-- visualization/  # Plotting and visualization
|   |-- main.py         # Main pipeline script
|-- notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis
|-- tests/            # Unit tests
|-- config/           # Configuration files
|-- results/          # Output from the pipeline (plots, tables)
|-- .gitignore        # Files to ignore by Git
|-- README.md         # This file
|-- PLAN.md           # Development plan
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd tno-agent
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the full data analysis pipeline, execute the main script:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

This will run the placeholder pipeline, which includes:
-   Fetching dummy data.
-   Running a placeholder simulation.
-   Applying a placeholder bias correction.
-   Calculating a placeholder p-value.
-   Generating an orbital distribution plot in `results/figures/`.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use the following command from the root directory:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
