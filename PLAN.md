# TNO Analysis Pipeline Development Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the development plan for the TNO Analysis Pipeline. The project's primary goal is to analyze the orbits of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) to infer the existence and properties of a hypothetical ninth planet (Planet 9) in the outer Solar System.

The pipeline will be built around three core scientific modules: N-body simulation, observational bias correction, and causal inference.

## 3. Core Modules

### 3.1. N-body Simulation
- **Purpose:** To accurately model the gravitational dynamics of the outer Solar System, including the Sun, known planets, and a hypothetical Planet 9.
- **Tasks:**
    - Integrate a robust N-body simulation library (e.g., REBOUND).
    - Develop functionality to generate synthetic populations of TNOs under different Planet 9 scenarios (e.g., varying mass, orbit).

### 3.2. Bias Correction
- **Purpose:** To account for the significant selection effects and biases present in existing TNO observation datasets.
- **Tasks:**
    - Implement models for major observational biases (e.g., pointing history of surveys, detection efficiency).
    - Develop a module to apply these corrections to both observed and synthetic TNO data to enable a fair comparison.

### 3.3. Causal Inference
- **Purpose:** To statistically evaluate the evidence for Planet 9 by comparing the observed TNO orbital data with the outcomes of the simulations.
- **Tasks:**
    - Implement a statistical framework to quantify the likelihood of the Planet 9 hypothesis.
    - Use causal inference techniques to distinguish correlation from causation in the TNO orbital clustering.

## 4. Development Phases

### Phase 1: N-body Simulation Module
- **Goal:** Create a functional simulator capable of generating realistic synthetic TNO data.
- **Timeline:** TBD
- **Key Tasks:**
    1. Select and validate an N-body simulation library.
    2. Implement initial conditions for the outer Solar System.
    3. Develop the synthetic TNO generation code.

### Phase 2: Bias Correction Module
- **Goal:** Develop and validate the bias correction algorithms.
- **Timeline:** TBD
- **Key Tasks:**
    1. Characterize biases from major TNO surveys.
    2. Implement the correction model.
    3. Test the model on synthetic data with known biases.

### Phase 3: Causal Inference & Analysis
- **Goal:** Build the statistical engine to compare data and derive conclusions.
- **Timeline:** TBD
- **Key Tasks:**
    1. Choose and implement appropriate statistical tests.
    2. Develop the comparison framework between observed and synthetic data.

### Phase 4: Pipeline Integration & Validation
- **Goal:** Combine all modules into a cohesive, end-to-end pipeline.
- **Timeline:** TBD
- **Key Tasks:**
    1. Create a master script or workflow to manage data flow between modules.
    2. Perform end-to-end validation using synthetic data.
    3. Run the full pipeline on the latest real TNO dataset.

## 5. Proposed Technology Stack
- **Primary Language:** Python
- **Core Libraries:**
    - **Simulation:** `rebound`
    - **Data Handling:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `astropy`
